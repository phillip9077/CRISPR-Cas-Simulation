# CRISPR-Cas-Simulation
This project discusses about one fundamental concept related to the innovative CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing tool: a bacteria's CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity system. As a biology major, I find that it helps to visualize biological mechanisms to fully understand the material; the CRISPR-Cas system is one of such mechanism that I feel would benefit from through some sort of simulation. Therefore, I developed a MVC-based simulation using Java and the Java Swing library.

The motivation for the MVC design is because I believe the adaptive immunity mechanism can be written as some sort of computer algorithm. For those of you who are interested in bioinformatics like myself, this project is a perfect way to start to see the intricate connections between biology and computer science.

Lastly, the actual coding of the simulation is simplified for various reasons. Firstly, for the sake of teaching students about this biological concept, the focus should be on maximizing the presentation of the simulation rather than how the simulation is made. Secondly, scientists don't know yet how the CRISPR-Cas system fully functions mechanically to completely mimic the biological process, thus I cannot develop a thorough algorithm even if I wanted to. The end goal is to facilitate an efficient learning experience regarding bacterial CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity, so the code can always be improved as I learn more about the interdisciplinary field of computer science and biology.
